# Airline Reservation System 

This is my Comp Sci second year J2EE project. The **Airline Reservation System** streamlines flight booking for users and administrators. It provides a user-friendly interface for passengers to search, select, and book flights easily. Additionally, it offers an admin dashboard for managing flight schedules, bookings, and user information efficiently.
